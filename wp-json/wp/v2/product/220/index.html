Metadata is information that is stored within a file that describes the file&#8217;s content or other attributes. This information can be very useful, as it can provide details about when and where a photo was taken, what camera and lens were used, and other important information.<\/p>\n<p>One of the primary uses of ExifTool is to extract metadata from files. This can be done by running the tool and specifying the file or files that you want to analyze. ExifTool will then scan the file and display a list of all the metadata that is stored within it. This information can include things like the date and time that the file was created or modified, the camera model that was used to take a photo, and the GPS coordinates of the location where a photo was taken.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to extracting metadata, ExifTool can also be used to edit metadata in files. This can be done by specifying the name of the tag that you want to modify, and then specifying the new value that you want to assign to it. For example, you might use ExifTool to change the date and time that a photo was taken, or to add new tags to a file that describe its content or other attributes.<\/p>\n<p>ExifTool supports a wide range of file formats, including popular ones like JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP3, WAV, and MP4. It can be used in batch processing, which means that you can specify a large number of files to analyze or edit all at once. This makes it a powerful tool for managing and organizing large collections of media files.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, ExifTool is a very useful tool for anyone who works with media files and wants to be able to extract or edit metadata. It provides a lot of detailed information about files, and it is very flexible and customizable, making it a valuable addition to any media management toolkit.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ExifTool is a platform-independent command-line tool for reading, writing, and editing metadata in image, audio, and video files<\/p>\n<p>Some of the information that ExifTool can extract and edit from files includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date and time information<\/li>\n<li>Camera and lens information<\/li>\n<li>GPS location data<\/li>\n<li>Image resolution and color space<\/li>\n<li>Author and copyright information<\/li>\n<li>Keywords and tags<\/li>\n<li>Audio file metadata, including track number and artist information<\/li>\n<li>Video file metadata, including codec information and frame rate<\/li>\n<li>ExifTool supports a wide range of file formats, including popular ones like JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP3, WAV, and MP4.
